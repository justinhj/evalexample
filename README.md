## Eval example

This repo contains code from the playlist and blog post series Functional Justin.

https://www.youtube.com/c/FunctionalJustin
http://justinhj.github.io/

Each video has a link to the source code and/or any external references you may find helpful.

The code is split into various sections.

* Root level - example programs
* livevideos - code you'll see me write during the videos
* org.justinhj - code that survives the videos that forms part of a growing library

Code functionally and have fun!
